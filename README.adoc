= Reprose

A configurable editor for React, based on ProseMirror
and written in TypeScript.

Provides tools and patterns that simplify rendering a document to HTML
in headless environments (e.g., Node or Electron main process)
where global window object is unavailable,
and for creating a rich editor React component.

The editor component provides an `onChange()` handler,
outputting data serialized as ProseMirror document structure.

== Features

Reproseâ€™s functionality is contained in _features_.
A feature can provide schema aspects (nodes, marks),
and authoring aspects (key bindings, menu items, ProseMirror plugins).

A few features come bundled with Reprose (work in progress).

== Example usage

NOTE: Rendering example to be added.

Obtaining a schema:

.schema.ts
[source,typescript]
----
import paragraph from '@riboseinc/reprose/features/paragraph/schema';
import lists from '@riboseinc/reprose/features/lists/schema';

import featuresToSchema from '@riboseinc/reprose/schema';

const schema = featuresToSchema([paragraph, lists]);

export default schema;
----

Obtaining an editor:

.editor.tsx
[source,typescript]
----
import blocky from '@riboseinc/reprose/features/blocky/author';
import paragraph from '@riboseinc/reprose/features/paragraph/author';
import lists from '@riboseinc/reprose/features/lists/author';

import featuresToEditorProps from '@riboseinc/reprose/author';
import Editor from '@riboseinc/reprose/author/editor';

import schema from './schema';

const editorProps = featuresToEditorProps([blocky, paragraph, lists], schema);

export default editor = (
  <Editor
    onChange={...}
    initialDoc={...}
    logger={log}
    {...editorProps}
  />
)
