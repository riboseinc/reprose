= Reprose

A configurable editor for React, based on ProseMirror
and written in TypeScript.

Provides tools and patterns that simplify rendering a document to HTML
in headless environments (e.g., Node or Electron main process)
where global window object is unavailable,
and for creating a rich editor React component.

The editor component provides an `onChange()` handler,
outputting data serialized as ProseMirror document structure.

== Features

Reproseâ€™s functionality is contained in _features_.
A feature can provide schema aspects (nodes, marks),
and authoring aspects (key bindings, menu items, ProseMirror plugins).

A few features come bundled with Reprose (work in progress).
